Renderer:
  - Optional dynamic pipelines that don't resize, not all need to be dynamic
  - Rerecording of command queues
  - One uniform buffer for all entities positions to render
  - Push constants
  - Remove global variables used by vulkan

Entities:
  - Implement entities
  - Lua scripting
  - Transform and Rigidbodies
  - Collision detection
  - Quadtree collision pruning
  - Maybe not automatically add to scene

Vulkan:
  - Image extent outside of bounds when resizing (nonfatal)
  - When skipping image aquire when waiting for resizes, there is a chance that uniform updates could get an invalid frame
  - Separate Images from Sampler
  - Specify graphics device support
  - Allow for long term mapping of buffer memory

General bugs:
  
Window:
  - Mouse pointer options
  - Hide cursor
  - (done) Window icon


General Features:
  - (done) Hashtable leak trace
  - Improve logging
  - Dynamic arrays
  - Better model loadings
  - Libjson to use arrays rather than linked lists
  - LOG_E to abort
